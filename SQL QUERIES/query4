-- Approach
-- use count function for bookings count 
-- use filter keyword to filter out flights and hotels bookings 

SELECT 

	user_id
  , COUNT(booking_id) FILTER( where Line_of_business='Flight') as no_of_flights_booking 
  , COUNT(booking_id) FILTER( where Line_of_business='Hotel') as no_of_hotels_booking 
  , EXTRACT(year from Booking_date) as Year_2022

FROM public.booking_table
group by user_id,  EXTRACT(year from Booking_date)
ORDER BY user_id




 Above query is not based on segemnt wise here is right query for Q4

SELECT U. Segment,
 SUM(CASE WHEN b. Line_of_business= 'Flight' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Flight ,
SUM(CASE WHEN b. Line_of_business= 'HOTEL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS HOTEL ,
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Booking_date) AS Year_2022
   FROM BOOKINGS B INNER JOIN USERS U ON B.User_id= U. User_id  GROUP BY U. Segment,EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Booking_date);
